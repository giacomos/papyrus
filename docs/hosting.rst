Server
======

The server is configured and setup via Ansible. All changes are done via Ansible, too, there is no need to login to do anything.

In the long run, weÄºl use kubernetes or so, in order to get there we'll take a couple of steps.
We do that on purpose, otherwise the transision and changes could be too hard to adopt fast.

Step 1
------

Use a LTS version of Ubuntu, setup and configuration is done via Ansible.
- has docker
- has nginx

Step 2
------

This could be kubernetes, but no worries, we are not there, yet.

Container
=========

There a number of containers running on the host:

- plone/docs5 [docs for Plone 5]
- plone/docs4 [docs for Plone 4]
- plone/docs3 [docs for Plone 3]
- portainer/portainer [for people who do not like command-line]

Maybe later to add there are currently not existing or/and out of scope:

- plone/training-landing
- plone/training-diazo
- plone/training-hosting
- plone/training-solr
- plone/training-mastering
- ...
- plone/planet
- plone/community

Nginx is currently not running in a container, but 'bare bone' on the host, changes and config are done via Ansible.

Questions
=========

- do we want zero downtime deployments ?
